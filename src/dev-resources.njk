<h1>Developer Resources</h1>

<p>A random, possibly useless list of <strong>resources</strong> aimed primarily at <strong>developers</strong> or<strong> software engineers</strong>, but with many for <strong>designers</strong>, <strong>UI and UX engineers</strong> as well. I try to make this list applicable to <i>anyone</i> in IT, including entrepreneurs, but know that it's not as comprehensive in each area of focus as I'd like it to be.</p>
<p>I try to stick with open source as much as possible, but note that sometimes there are proprietary tools on here (listed with a $ sign). As of this moment I do not have any affiliate links on here and am only sharing what I find may genuinely be useful to some.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd love for this to be community-driven. Please <a href="https://www.nerdycode.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let me know</a> if you have any resources you'd like to share. :)</p>
