      <p>Hello, world. My name is Rachel and I wear my sunglasses at night. I'm also a software engineer at Red Hat.</p>

      <p>I've been a "webmaster" since the 90s (weren't we all?). I sometimes blog about technology from the perspective
      of a pragmatic developer, other times I blog about rainbows and unicorns. I've proudly been eating cheese since
      I grew my first baby tooth.</p>

      <p>I was born in the beautiful Dominican Republic. I later went on to study Chemistry in college, but eventually
      decided to do what I had been doing for fun for most of my life -- lounging around, eating pizza, and writing
        code -- instead.</p>

      <p className="marquee">
   <span>
     Things I like: dancing - ballet, jazz+modern, jumping around, etc; dogs; eating - cheese, sticky toffee pudding; whiskey + beer; climbing trees; programming; science; documentaries; learning; music; playing the guitar; mechanical keyboards; pizza
   </span>
