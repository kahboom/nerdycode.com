Under construction.


It feels like there is a new JavaScript framework every year that takes the frontend world by storm. Everyone migrates to it. Conferences are scheduled. Devs flock to create plugins or themes for it.

To be fair, it's often an exciting period of time, because it feels like you're part of something new and exciting, and it seems like it has the potential to solve a lot of your existing problems. But the truth is, the problem with adopting a new framework every couple of years is that it creates a lot of technical debt, some of it rather unwarranted technical debt.

I'm not much of a purist, but I do believe in creating sustainable solutions. If we are to embrace the continuously evolving world of frontend development, we need to better accommodate it from an architectural perspective.

While frameworks such as React and Angular are very well documented, Web components are a standard. As in, an actual RFC standard.

And that's as far as I'll go in terms of comparing the two. The problem with comparing web components to SPA frameworks is that you make the assumption that they are mutually exclusive. They can be used together.
