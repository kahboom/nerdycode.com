Migrating my blog to Eleventy.

I wanted to try something different.

Do we rely on JS and third-party libs too much? Of course. As a frontend developer, this is a huge challenge for me.

Some requirements I set for myself:

- You can use SCSS wherever necessary.
- The theme must have a dropdown navigation menu.
- The landing page needs to have a slider.

In the end, I decided that my creative expression and user experience were both more important for me, so I opted to
 use JS.
