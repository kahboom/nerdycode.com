I’m wide open  
But don’t I please you anymore?  
You’re slipping away from me  
You’re drifting away from me

I’m wide open  
But don’t I please you anymore?  
You’re slipping away from me  
You’re slipping away from me

Slow me down  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me

Slow me down  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me

I’m wide open  
But I couldn’t see it anymore  
You’re drifting away from me  
You’re slipping away from me

I’m wide open  
I’m wide open  
I’m wide open

One day just gonna see me  
Look back and forth from the ceiling  
(I’m wide open)  
Some day love’s gonna hurt me  
Turn back and soon I’ll believe it

Slow me down  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me

Slow me down  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me

I’m wide open  
I’m wide open

Slow me down  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me  
It’s getting away from me
