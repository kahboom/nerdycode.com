Hello, world. My name is Rachel, and I'm a software engineer at Red Hat. I've also been a "webmaster" since the 90s.

I sometimes blog about technology from the perspective of a decidedly pragmatic developer, other times I blog about mechanical keyboards and Predator.

I was born in the beautiful Dominican Republic (I'm Latin/Hispanic). I later went on to study Chemistry in college, but eventually decided to make a career out of what I had been doing for most of my life instead, namely, lounging around, eating pizza, and writing code.

I've worked on software for everything from children's education to distributed enterprise software. My main interests in tech are human-computer interaction and embedded programming. I'm also very interested in the juxtaposition of old school computing with the modern web.
