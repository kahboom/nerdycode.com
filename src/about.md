My name is Rachel, and I'm a software engineer at Red Hat. I've also been a "webmaster" since the 90s.

I sometimes blog about technology from the perspective of a decidedly pragmatic developer, other times I blog about mechanical keyboards and Predator.

I was born in the Dominican Republic. I'm left-handed and a little bit weird. I studied Chemistry in college, but eventually decided to make a career out of what I had been doing for most of my life instead, namely, lounging around, eating pizza, and coding.

My interests in tech are IoT and embedded, though I specialize in web dev.
